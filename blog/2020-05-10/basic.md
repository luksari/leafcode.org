Have you started looking for the first junior developer job?
Or maybe you have been already employed as junior and you feel lost in new company?
It does not matter, because those concepts can be applied to everybody who wants to strengthen its skills as software developer.

<!-- 1 -->
## Well prepared roadmap

Have you ever heard about developer roadmap?
Unless you don't, **Developer roadmap** contains technologies and concepts, that you should get to know during your learning process which never ends in IT industry.
Example roadmap created by [Kamran Ahmed](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) will truly help you understand this concept of milestones and decisions that you have to make during learning process.

<!-- 1.1 -->
### Developer core

Every software development connected job requires some basics, like usage of [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, understanding how does development platform works, basic usage of `CLI` (Command line interface) and usage of code editor.

<!-- 1.2 -->
### Speciality

The most important part is connected mostly with your preferences and should be created by yourself, you should stick to this roadmap for some time of your career, you will feel awarded, when you see how much you would have done, to be in this particular place.

## Don't be scared of asking questions

You have no idea how to solve your particular problem? Don't panic, solving problem is the real struggle during software development process, you will learn how to do it properly over time.

<!-- 2.1 -->
### Ask yourself a question

At first try to ask yourself a simple questions like: *why did it happen*, *what does not work*, *how did it happen* etc. Answers of those questions will help you with building the accurate question, or even give you answer. If it didn't solve your problem, here comes the second step.

<!-- 2.2 -->
### Let me google that for you

You should start looking for a similiar problems in browser, there is a lot of sources like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Github issues](https://github.com/issues), documentation of library that might have caused the problem. Learning how to get answers from similiar issuse is super valuable in software development process, most of problems in basic functionalities are really common. Don't spend the whole day on searching through whole documentation, give yourself **15-30 minutes**, if you feel that you are stuck, here comes the last step.

<!-- 2.3 -->
### Helpful teammates

Some of your more experienced teammates might have encountered similiar problem before, and they will be able to ask your questions in just **2 minutes.** Don't be scared of asking them, because you are team that have the very same goal, and it is to create great product that people will love.

Remember not to change the order of steps, especially, you should not treat asking your fellow teammates as the first step, because they also have their own problems to solve, and yours might be really easy to find in the internet on your own.

## Todo lists
<!-- IMAGE of completed task -->

Creating todo lists is very important thing, everybody loves to see the goals that have been reached.
It gives you preview what have you done each day, so you will keep your team updated of progress in bigger tasks.
Todo lists are quite connected with being agile, if you create your tasks earnestly, you will succeed in future plannings, estimations, calls with clients, which all happens during process of software development.
Try to split every task that you have into smaller pieces, more is better in this case, if you count completed task you will be proud of youself, it will give you efficiency boost.

## Do not feed your imposter syndrome

Experiencing imposter syndrome happens to a lot of people during their early path of career. It is quite uncomfortable feeling, when you try to compare yourself with the other, more experienced people from your environment. If it didn't happen to you, woah you are lucky, or just simply confident, which is a big advantage.

<!-- 4.1 -->
### Past comparision

Being succesfull and improving yourself means that you have to see improvements, in order to reach the new goals, focus on yourself while developing your skills.
Can you spot the improvement when you comare yourself from 6 months before? Probably the answer is **yes**, because learning curve is fast growing during early path of career, and that is good, you can set new goals, you can keep improving yourself. Try not to focus on skills of your teammates, they are longer in this industry, so they had more time to develop their skills, they took part in many projects and the most important probably experienced the very same thing through their career, and won this fight.
