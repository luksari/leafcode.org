Have you already started looking for the first junior developer job?
Or maybe you have been already employed as junior and you feel lost in the new company?
These concepts can be applied to everybody who wants to strengthen its skills as software developer.

<!-- 1 -->
## Well prepared roadmap

Have you ever heard about developer roadmap?
Unless you don't, **Developer roadmap** contains technologies and concepts, that you should get to know during your learning process which never ends in IT industry.
Example roadmap created by [Kamran Ahmed](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) will truly help you understand this concept of milestones and decisions that you have to make during learning process.

<!-- 1.1 -->
### Developer core

Every software development connected job requires some basics, like usage of [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, understanding how does development platform works, basic usage of `CLI` (Command line interface) and usage of code editor, so you should try to focus on them at first, it will help you with every aspect of your work.

<!-- 1.2 -->
### Speciality

The most important part is connected mostly with your preferences and should be created by yourself, you should preprare this part of roadmap by yourself and stick to this roadmap for some time of your career.
Try to find the non common part that is going to be your speciality, and you will present yourself as e.g Data Visualisation Junior Specialist when you will learn ways how to present in applications.
You are going to feel awarded, when you see how much you have done, to be in this particular place.

## Don't be scared of asking questions

You have no idea how to solve your particular problem? Don't panic, solving problem is the real struggle during software development process, you will learn how to do it properly over time.

<!-- 2.1 -->
### Ask yourself a question

At first try to ask yourself a simple questions like: *why did it happen*, *what does not work*, *when did it happen* etc. Answers of those simple questions will help you with building the accurate question, or even will give you an answer. If it didn't solve your problem, here comes the second step.

<!-- 2.2 -->
### Let me google that for you

You should start looking for a similiar problems in the browser, there is a lot of sources like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Github issues](https://github.com/issues), documentation of library that might have caused the problem. Learning how to get the answers from similiar issuses is super valuable in software development process, most of problems in basic functionalities are really common. Don't spend the all day on searching through whole documentation, give yourself **15-30 minutes**, if you feel that you are stuck, here comes the last step.

<!-- 2.3 -->
### Helpful teammates

Some of your more experienced teammates might have encountered similiar problem before, and they will be able to answer your questions in just **2 minutes.** Don't be scared of asking them, because you all are the team that have the very same goal, and it is to create great product that people will love.

Remember not to change the order of steps, especially, you should not treat asking your fellow teammates as the first step, because they also have their own problems to solve, and yours might be really easy to find in the internet on your own, so start with simple *what/why/when?* question.

<!-- 3 -->
## Todo lists

Creating todo lists is very important thing, everybody loves to see their own goals that have been reached.
It gives you preview what have you done each day, so you will keep your team updated of progress in bigger tasks.
Todo lists are quite connected with being agile, if you create your tasks earnestly, you will succeed in future plannings, estimations, calls with clients, which all happens during process of software development.
Try to split every task that you have into smaller pieces, more is better in this case, if you count completed task you will be proud of youself which will result in your efficiency boost.

## Do not feed your imposter syndrome

Experiencing imposter syndrome happens to a lot of people during their early path of career. It is quite uncomfortable feeling, when you try to compare yourself with the other, more experienced people from your environment. If it didn't happen to you, woah you are lucky, or just simply confident, which is a big advantage of you.

<!-- 4.1 -->
### Past comparision

Being succesfull and improving yourself means that you have to see improvements, in order to reach the new goals, focus on yourself while developing your skills.
Can you spot the improvements when you compare to yourself from 6 months before? Probably the answer is **yes**, because learning curve is fast growing during early path of career, and that is good, you can set the new goals, you can keep improving yourself. Try not to focus on skills of your teammates, they are longer in this industry, so they had more time to develop their skills, they took part in many projects and the most important probably experienced the very same thing with imposter syndrome through their career, and they won this fight.

<!-- 4.2 -->
### Atomic Goals

In order to measure your goals, you should atomize them, try not to set it to *I want to learn Javascript*, but maybe something more precise like *I want to understand event bubbling in Javascript*, it will be easier for you to check if you have fullfilled all of the requirements for this particular goal.

<!-- 5 -->
## Side projects

Creating side projects can improve both, your soft and hard skills, it will also protect you from the burnout.

<!-- 5.1 -->
### Opensource

Taking part in opensource or non commercial projects are really helpful for your portfolio and skills, you will learn how to create pull requests, how to resolve issuses, how to talk with people, also maybe you will meet some group of programming hotheads to work with on your own project

<!-- 5.2 -->
### Your own projects

Did you find the group of enthusiasts to help you with your side project? If yes, Amazing. You are going to learn how to work in team with people from various environments. If not, you are not in worse situation, you have a possibility to create a lot of small projects that will base on your creativity, and will improve your self management skills.

<!-- 6 -->
## Solidyfing knowledge

You can find a lot of knowledge in the internet, but reading or watching them won't give you the best results, you should solidify your knowledge by practicing.

<!-- 6.1 -->
### Create notes

While learning try to create notes with definitions of accurate issues, it is going to give you huge knowledge base, written in your words so it will be more understable for you.

<!-- 6.2 -->
### Blogging

Start your learning journey with creating simple Wordpress blog, where you will post content, that you have learnt overtime, don't be scared of that the accurate topic have been already fulfilled or you made some mistakes, you will learn how to organise your notes and share the knowledge to be easily understandable by readers, also it is going to build your self confidence and expert personality.

<!-- 6.3 -->
### Memory cards

Create memory cards, it will solidify harder definitions in your brain, repeating the very same definitions in time intervals is extremely good exercise for your brain. I can recommend you [Anki app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which has a lot of features to create really nice working memory cards base.

<!-- 7 -->
## Care about yourself

The last but not least, I would say the most important part for begginer developers is to remember about both, mental and physical health, bad condition is fast way to burnout, which nobody wants to experience. Self care is really important to improve your stress management, that is why I see this section as the most important for you.

<!-- 7.1 -->
### Take breaks

Remember about taking regular brakes, step away from your desk sometimes, take a breath, do some exercises or stretching in this time, you back will thank you for sure. I can suggest you [Pomodorro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), which bases on taking regular brakes in some interval, for me perfectly works **55 minutes** of work, and **5 minutes** break, sometimes I take a longer break to have yoga, meditation session or simple stretching.

<!-- 7.2 -->
### Repetitive strain injury

These brakes will prevent you from **RSI** (Repetitive strain injury) which might be a real struggle later on, if you keep your position fixed for a long time, there are some [Anti RSI apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_repetitive_strain_injury_software) that can help you with monitoring your off screen time, personally I use [Safe Eyes](https://slgobinath.github.io/SafeEyes/) for Linux, but all kind of software might be helpful.

## Summary

Woah this was a great pill of advices, all of them are equally important in your career development, I will keep my fingers crossed for you, and hope so that you will apply these tips in your daily basis.
