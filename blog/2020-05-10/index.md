Have you started looking for the first junior developer job?
Or maybe you have been already employed as junior and you feel lost in new company?
It does not matter, because those rules can be applied to everybody who wants to strengthen its skills as software developer.

## Well prepared roadmap

**Developer roadmap** contains technologies and concepts, that you should get to know,
because for sure you will use them for creating awesome software in your work.

It will help you with reaching easily measurable milestones, roadmaps will boost your productivity.
For simplicity, I will present you examples basing on web developer roadmap.
It does not matter if you want to be Java backend developer, React frontend ninja, or fullstack master, some technologies and concepts are
common.

### Web fundamentals

You should feel comfortable with web fundamentals like `HTTP/HTTPS`, `SSH`, `REST`, `DNS`, domains and hostings, what are proxy and ports, those kind of stuff, you don't have to be expert with those definitions, just try not to be scared when you hear *can you login to server through `SSH`?*.

### Version control

The very next thing is version control system, it allows you to track changes during process of software development. Imagine passing pendrive to your teammate, when you want to show him some changes that you have done, fortunately those days had already passed. There are few version control systems, but the most know is for sure [git](https://git-scm.com/), and I would suggest you to start with this one.

### CLI - Command line interface

Okay, this may seem scary for you, *doing stuff with terminal only?!* You may ask, I would say not only, but you should be comfortable with listing files with `ls`, going inside directories with `cd` or doing some basic write operations from `CLI` because most of developer tools are based on command line interface, like previously mentioned `git`. I can guarantee you, that if you learn this, you will improve your efficiency.

### Code editor

Pick one basic code editor, I can suggest you [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that is free and have a lot of extensions. For begginer purposes it will fulfill your requirements. Learn some shortcusts, get used to going through files, get some workflow, it will boost up your focus on future tasks.

The rest of roadmap is based on your future job preferences, and skills that you want to improve. Let's check out this website with example roadmaps [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)
