# What is three.js

Three.js is a library that allows you to opperate on 3D scenes in browser,
normally you can position elements on 3 axis X, Y, Z. 
Three.js allows you to add some additional informations, meshes,
light points and camera settings, like in Unity, like in every 3D game üòÑ


## Scene

Scene contains **meshes** and **lights**, 
lights are just lights, simple points that act like a light bulb with a lot of properties to set üí°
But meshes are little bit more complex, they consist of geometry of accurate shape, and material of this shape. Like cuboid ‚¨õÔ∏è made from metal ü§ò

## Camera

**Camera** is some kind of the point that looks to the whole scene, it has properties like `[x,y,z]` position,
it is not placed on scene by itself, but you will see it in code more clearly

## Initialization

First we need a little bit of HTML in `index.html` with our `index.js` script and Three.js for example this one [Three.js CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/110/three.min.js) from cdn

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>3Ô∏è‚É£.js playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/110/three.min.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

Okay, our `index.html` is ready to go, but we also need `index.js` file that we will use to perform 3D operations with usage of Three.js library.
Because we have included Three.js in `index.html`, we can use `THREE` object straightforward 

```javascript

```
